# OHR-X-Lechnology-Hackable-Lamp

This project is a collaboration between **OHR Design** ([ohrdesign.ca](https://ohrdesign.ca)) and **Lechnology Engineering** ([lechnology.ca](https://lechnology.ca)) to create a hackable, customizable electronic lamp.

### ‚ú® Purpose
This lamp is designed to be **fully hackable** ‚Äî to encourage learning, prototyping, and creativity.

### üõ†Ô∏è Platform
- **Arduino framework** for accessibility and extensibility
- **ESP32 microcontroller** for robust wireless and peripheral capabilities

### üîß Features
- Servo motor control
- WS2812 (NeoPixel-style) LED animations using FastLED
- Modular, object-oriented firmware structure (C++ with Allman style)

### üß† Motivation
While I typically write embedded firmware in **C**, this project was an opportunity to challenge myself with **modern C++**. I wanted to explore its capabilities ‚Äî like classes, namespaces, and templates ‚Äî and familiarize myself with best practices in real-world embedded applications.

This project is ideal for engineers, makers, and designers who want to modify or build on top of an embedded lighting and motion platform.
